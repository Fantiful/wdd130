    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>To stimulate, illustrate, and educate all who view the site on the joys of white whiter rafting!
        The business point of this website is to get viewers excited about white water rafting and view it as something they will not only be excited about but also want to get involved in. 
        Similar to FOMO (Fear of missing out) the site is meant to make you feel like this is a fun experience you have been missing out on and want to get involved with.
        Additionally, it could act as a marketing platform where customers could buy white water rafting gear, be linked to platform that sell gear, list locations where white water rafting can be experienced.</p>
    <!-- change this -->

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>Those who are new to white water rafting and have little to no prior knowledge or experience and want to get involved. 
       Potential, supplemental materials for already experienced rafters with the location listing, purchasable gear, and community forum.</p>
