    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>The picture is of me (On the right in the hat.), my brothe (In the back with the muttonchops), and our good friend (In the front taking the photo.) on a hiking trip.</p>

    <p>My degree is in applied public health, but I honestly thought it would be cool to explore web design since it was something I am also interested in. I figured baptism by fire and see what happens. I remember taking a very beginner friendly programming class years ago and enjoying it so I'm hoping like that class it will also be a fun and amazing experience similar to that. </p>
    <p>With the internet being such an integral part of our modern world and I really do believe that knowing something about web design could be beneficial regardless of the profession. I hope to find fun and unique ways to use the skills developed from this class in my own personal ways.</p>
    <p>When it comes to hobbies, I would say that I love to read. I recently finished reading the 48 Laws of Power and The 5 AM Club. Both are excellent books and would recommend to anyone who enjoys self help or learning material. I am currently reading Stephin King A Memoir of the Craft On Writing. I'm about halfway through it and I must say that that man is quite the unique individual. But it is still a great read but not recommended for younger readers. Additionally, I also enjoy playing video/board games with my family and friends.</p>
